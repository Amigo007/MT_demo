    This is a quite intuitive way to associate statistical methods and rule based methods,in this version,we just made an easy intuitive demo.
I do believe if we can enumerate most of the rules about how to recognize clauses, this method can work quite well.
    I do believe this way can make our translation results much better than those from Baidu or Google.
    If you have any questions or you have some other ideas want to share with me,Welcome.
